Ethereum's recent surge has captured market attention as the cryptocurrency breaks above critical price barriers. This article explores technical patterns, analyst insights, and key levels shaping ETH's short-term trajectory.  

## Ethereum's Technical Breakthrough  

Ethereum (ETH) has surged 7.5% in the daily timeframe, reclaiming $2,550 and establishing a bullish foundation. This movement marks the first successful breach of this resistance in weeks, with ETH climbing from $2,380 to $2,585 â€“ a two-week high. The cryptocurrency has oscillated between $2,400 and $2,800 since May's breakout but struggled to maintain $2,550 as support until this latest rally.

### Market Context and Analyst Perspectives  
Today's broader market recovery, including Bitcoin's surge to $109,600, has intensified bullish sentiment. Daan Crypto Trades described ETH's movement as "a clean breakout of the local range," emphasizing the importance of maintaining $2,520 as support. Failure to hold this level could trigger a retest of the $2,310 support zone, while sustained strength might propel prices toward $2,735 resistance.  

Technical analyst Merlijn The Trader highlighted Ethereum's three-month ascending triangle pattern â€“ a classic bullish continuation formation. The cryptocurrency has repeatedly tested its rising support line during corrections, with the current breakout targeting $2,700 as the next major resistance.  

> "Ethereum is charging up. Higher lows, strong base, bullish MACD crossover. A clean break of $2,700... and ETH will fly. $3,000 is just the beginning."  

## Historical Patterns and Future Projections  

Merlijn identified a recurring two-year cycle in ETH's price action since 2018:  
1. **Base Formation**: Consolidation phase establishing institutional support  
2. **Rejection & Retest**: Price tests base lows without breaking  
3. **Liftoff Phase**: Explosive breakout to new all-time highs  

The 2020-2022 cycle saw ETH surge from $100 to $4,878, suggesting significant upside potential from its current $2,568 price point. Analyst Kaleo noted structural similarities between current price patterns and previous cycles, observing that ETH's 68% retracement from its ATH mirrors Bitcoin's pre-bull market consolidation in 2020.
