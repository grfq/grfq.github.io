## Step 1: Prepare Your Accounts  

Before initiating any transfer, ensure both your **Huobi and Binance accounts** meet the following requirements:  

1. **Account Verification**: Complete KYC (Know Your Customer) verification on both platforms to avoid withdrawal limits.

## Step 2: Access Huobi Wallet  

1. Log in to your [Huobi account](https://www.huobi.com/) using your credentials.  
2. Navigate to the **Wallet** section (usually found in the main dashboard or under "Assets").  
3. Locate USDT in your holdings and click **Withdraw**.  

## Step 3: Configure Withdrawal Settings  

This critical step requires precise information to prevent irreversible losses:  

### 3.1 Binance USDT Deposit Address  

1. Log in to your **Binance account**.  
2. Go to **Wallet > Withdraw**.  
3. Select **USDT** and choose the appropriate network (explained in Section 5).  
4. Copy the **Deposit Address** carefully.  

### 3.2 Network Selection (ERC-20 vs BEP-20)  

| Network Type | Blockchain | Transaction Speed | Gas Fees |  
|--------------|------------|-------------------|----------|  
| ERC-20       | Ethereum   | 5-15 minutes      | Higher   |  
| BEP-20       | Binance Chain | 1-3 minutes     | Lower    |  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Warning**: Always match the network type on both exchanges. Sending ERC-20 USDT to a BEP-20 address (or vice versa) will result in permanent loss.  

### 3.3 Amount Specification  

Enter the amount of USDT you wish to transfer. Verify:  
- The amount exceeds Huobi's minimum withdrawal limit (varies by network)  
- You've reserved sufficient funds for gas fees  

## Step 4: Confirm & Execute Transfer  

1. Double-check the deposit address and network type in the withdrawal confirmation window.  
2. Complete Huobi's verification process (SMS/Email/Google Authenticator).  
3. Click **Submit** to initiate the blockchain transaction.

2. Wait for network confirmations (typically 1-15 minutes).  
3. Verify the full balance appears in your Binance account.  

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting  

### Why Isn't My USDT Showing Up?  

| Possible Cause | Solution |  
|----------------|----------|  
| Network mismatch | Contact support immediately if funds were sent to wrong network |  
| Network congestion | Wait longer during peak Ethereum/Binance Chain activity |  
| Incorrect address | Recovery may be possible if recipient address is controlled by exchange |  

### How to Check Transaction Status  

1. Use blockchain explorers like [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) (ERC-20) or [BscScan](https://bscscan.com/) (BEP-20).  
2. Enter the transaction hash from Huobi's confirmation page.  

## Security Best Practices  

1. **Address Verification**: Always cross-check wallet addresses character-by-character.  
2. **Small Test Transfer**: Send a small amount first when transferring large sums.  
3. **Phishing Protection**: Never share 2FA codes or private keys.
