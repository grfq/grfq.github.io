2. Select **"Withdraw"** from the dropdown menu or use the search bar to locate **USDT** directly.

### Step 2: Select USDT and Choose the Network  
1. From the withdrawal interface, select **USDT** as the cryptocurrency.  
2. Choose the appropriate **network (e.g., TRC20, ERC20, BEP20)**.  
   - **TRC20**: Lowest fees, fastest confirmations.  
   - **ERC20**: Higher fees, slower confirmations.  
   - **BEP20**: Binance’s native network, balanced fees and speed.
