### Critical Support Levels Broken

Both leading cryptocurrencies lost critical support zones that had previously contained their downward momentum:
- **Bitcoin**: $18,200-$18,400 support zone breached
- **Ethereum**: $1,251 monthly support level collapsed

This technical breakdown signals potential for further downside pressure as algorithmic trading systems and stop-loss orders activate additional selling mechanisms.

## Bitcoin Price Analysis

BTC has entered a bearish phase with four consecutive days of declines totaling 18%. The breakdown below key psychological levels has created a self-reinforcing cycle of selling pressure. Technical indicators show:
- RSI at extreme oversold levels (28)

### Short-Term Outlook

The immediate technical outlook remains negative with potential for testing new lows:
1. **Primary Support**: $16,500 psychological level
2. **Secondary Target**: $15,000 round number support

Traders should monitor the 50-day moving average ($20,430) as a potential resistance zone for recovery attempts.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why did Bitcoin and Ethereum crash so severely?

The collapse of FTX triggered a liquidity crisis as market participants rushed to exit positions. The interconnected nature of crypto markets amplified the selling pressure across all major assets.

### Are we witnessing a market bottom?

While technical indicators show extreme oversold conditions, traditional market bottoms require sustained accumulation. Current on-chain metrics suggest some whale buying but retail capitulation continues.

This cycle shows similarities to 2018 and 2020 corrections but with unique exchange-related risks. Recovery timelines may extend beyond typical 12-18 month bear market durations.

### Should traders focus on Bitcoin or Ethereum?

BTC offers better relative strength indicators currently, but ETH's ecosystem advantages position it for stronger recovery once market stability returns.
