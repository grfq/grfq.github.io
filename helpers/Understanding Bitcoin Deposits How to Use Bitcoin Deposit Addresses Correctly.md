# Understanding Bitcoin Deposits: How to Use Bitcoin Deposit Addresses Correctly

## What Is a Bitcoin Deposit?

A **Bitcoin deposit** refers to transferring Bitcoin from one wallet address to another, typically to facilitate trading, investment, or asset exchanges on platforms like cryptocurrency exchanges. This process involves sending Bitcoin to a designated **deposit address**, which acts as a unique identifier for receiving funds. Understanding this mechanism is critical for secure and efficient crypto transactions.

## Core Concepts of Bitcoin Deposits

### How Bitcoin Deposits Work
Similar to traditional banking deposits, Bitcoin deposits leverage blockchain technology. Users transfer funds from personal wallets or exchange accounts to a specific **deposit address** provided by the receiving platform. This address ensures Bitcoin reaches the correct destination, whether for trading, staking, or storage.

### Key Components of Deposit Addresses
1. **P2PKH (Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash) Addresses**:  
   - Start with "1"  
   - Traditional format for single-signature transactions  

2. **P2SH (Pay-to-Script-Hash) Addresses**:  
   - Start with "3"  
   - Support advanced features like multi-signature security  

Both address types maintain transaction integrity but cater to different use cases. For most users, verifying address accuracy remains the priority.

     - Check blockchain explorers (e.g., blockchain.com) to confirm transaction status  
     - Verify if the platform requires additional confirmations  

### Problem 3: **Minimum Deposit Requirements**
