# First US Solana ETF With Staking Debuts $8M Trade in 20 Minutes, Underperforms Against ETH  

## Groundbreaking Launch Amidst Market Skepticism  

On March 2, 2025, **REX-Osprey's Solana Staking ETF (SSK)** made history as the first staking-enabled Solana ETF to debut on the Cboe BZX Exchange. The product attracted $8 million in trading volume within its first 20 minutes, surging to $33 million by market close â€“ placing it among the top 1% of new ETF launches by trading volume. This milestone marks a significant evolution in cryptocurrency investment vehicles, yet the native SOL token struggled to maintain momentum, revealing complex market dynamics.

### Key Innovations in Crypto ETF Structure  

The ETF's unique structure combines direct Solana exposure with staking returns through a 1940 Act C-Corp framework with 6C-11 exemption. Notable features include:  
- **45% allocation to 21Shares Solana Staking ETP**  
- **Monthly cash distributions** of staking rewards to shareholders  
- **No requirement for investors to manage blockchain infrastructure**  

This hybrid approach addresses institutional demand for regulated staking returns while maintaining liquidity through traditional ETF mechanics.  

## Market Reaction: Why SOL Lagged Behind ETH  

Despite the ETF's explosive debut, SOL's price movement disappointed bulls. The token:  
- **Fell 7.8% in pre-launch trading**  
- **Risen just 3.6% vs. ETH's 7.1% surge** post-launch  
- Traded at $209.40 while ETH approached $2,600  

| Asset | 24H Change | Price (Launch Day) |  
|-------|------------|--------------------|  
| SOL   | +3.6%      | $209.40            |  
| ETH   | +7.1%      | $2,587             |  
| BTC   | +3.4%      | $61,200            |  

### FAQ: Understanding Market Dynamics  

**Q: Why did SOL underperform despite the ETF launch?**  
A: Pre-launch selling pressure suggests "buy the rumor, sell the news" behavior. Technical analysis reveals SOL breaking key support levels during the ETF's regulatory approval phase.  

**Q: How does staking integration affect ETF performance?**  
A: The 45% ETP allocation creates indirect exposure, potentially diluting price impact compared to direct holdings. However, this structure enables tax-efficient staking returns.  

## SEC's Regulatory Greenlight: A Strategic Shift  

The SEC's "no objection" stance represents a critical policy evolution. This approval:  
- **Validates staking as an acceptable ETF mechanism**  
- **Avoids traditional 19b-4 ETF review processes**  
- **Paves the way for 7 pending Solana ETF applications**

### Implications for Crypto ETF Landscape  

Analysts interpret this as a precursor to broader institutional adoption:  
1. **Taxation of staking rewards** now follows ETF framework rather than direct crypto rules  
2. **Institutional demand** could increase through simplified custody solutions  
3. **Market timing** suggests potential "Crypto ETF Summer" in late 2025  

### FAQ: Tax Considerations for Investors  

**Q: How are staking rewards taxed through this ETF?**  
A: Distributions increase the fund's net asset value, triggering taxable events classified as ordinary income, capital gains, or return of capital.  

**Q: What are the ETF's expense ratios?**  
A: Total annual operating expenses of 1.40% include:  
- 0.75% management fee  
- 0.65% estimated tax provision  

## Competitive Landscape and Future Outlook  

While REX leads in Solana ETF innovation, challenges remain:  
- **Liquidity concerns** without BlackRock-scale assets  
- **Performance tracking differences** vs. direct SOL holdings  
- **Regulatory uncertainty** for remaining ETF applications
